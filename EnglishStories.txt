THE HARE AND THE ELEPHANTS

The-story of-the-hare and the-elephants.
He-is-there formerly the-hare, and-he-lives (or sits)
by-the-river, and-be-gets (or sees) one-day the-elephants
who-go the-kraals of-the-fathers-in-law their.
And-he-says-to the-big-one who-carrying-is the-bag
of-the-honey : ' Father, (you) make-cross-me the-water, for
l-am poor.'
And-he-him-says-to the-elephant : ' Come ! enter (or mount)
' the-back my.'
And-he-it-enters (or mounts) the-hare, and-they-go.
Now they-it-cross, and-he-eats the-hare the-honey
of-the-elephant, but not-they-know the-elephants to-say (or that)
he-it-eating-is.
Now he-it-eating-is, and-it-him-drops-to the-elephant the-juice
of-the-honey.
And-he-says the-elephant : What this which-me-drops-to ? '
And-he-says the-hare: 'The-tears of-the-child poor.'
Now When they-reach that-bank, and-he-them-says-to the-hare :
(Ye)-give-me the-stones which-I-throw-at the-birds.'
And-it-him-given-is.
And-he-puts-in the-hare the-stones into the-bag
of-the-honey
Now when he-finishes, and-he-them-says-to :
' (Ye)-make-descend-hither-me.'
And-it-him-made-descend-hither-is, and-he-them-says-to: 'Well
then, (ye)-go.'
And-they-go until they-may-reach the-kraal
of-the-father-in-law of-the-elephant big, and-they-sit-down
and-they-unfasten the-bag of-the-honey, and-they-it-look-thither (or regard)
and-they-find the-stones only which-are-there.
And-they-jump, and-they-it-see it-eating-is.
the-hare, and-they-it-see it-eating--is
No when he-them-sees the-hare, and-he-enters the-hole
And-they-him-follow the-of-the-arms, and-he-puts-in the-big-one
the-arm his the-hole, and-he-seizes the-leg of-the-hare.
And-he-him-says-to the-hare: 'I-say I you-seized-have
the-root.'
And-he-it-leaves, and-he-seizes the-root.
And-he-him-says-to the-hare: 'You-me-have-broken,
you-me-have-broken.'
And-he-it-pulls the-of-the-arm very, and-he-it-pulls until 
he-may-tire-himself.
Now he-it-pulling=is, and-he-runs-away the-hare,
and-he-runs-away-thither the-elephant.
And-he-goes the-hare, and-he-gets the-baboons, and-he-says 
the-hare:'O-the-males! (ye)-prevent-hither-me (or intercede-for-me).'
And-they-him-say-to the-baboons: 'What which-it-you-chasing-is?'
And-he-says the-hare: 'The-big-man fat, now
and-ye-him-see he-mi-follows-hither.'
And-they-say the baboons: 'Go you sit
that-we-him-may-see hither for not-we-you-givethither you.'
And-he-goes the-hare in the-cave, and-they-sit
the-baboons to-await the-elephant. 
And-he-comes the-elephant, and-he-says: 'The-friends
ye-have-seen the-hare who-passed here?'
And-they-say the-baboons: 'What you-us-give us
if we-you-tell you?'
And-he-says the elephant: 'I-ye-give ye the-thing
that-ye-wish-will.'
And-they-him-say-to the-baboons: 'Not-we-wish-shall
other-thing, the-bllod your we-wish-shall, 
and-we-you-shoot(or cup) you in-the-small gourd.'
And-he-says the elephant: 'Small this-little-(thing)?
Come-(ye), (ye)-shoot-me.'
And-they-it-go the-baboons to-catch, and-they-catch very. 
And-he-says the-elephant: did-not only it-fills
And-they-say-to the-baboons the-elephant: 'Not-you-have
and again the-honour Not-you-are-able-thither
this-little-gourd
And-he-it-looks-thither the-elephant, and-he-it-finds
did-not it-fills, for it-pierced-becomes the-bottom of-the-gourd,
but not-he-it-knows, and-he-says: '(Ye)-fill-(it).'
And-it-caught-is until may-it-finished-become the-blood
in-the-body, and-he-dies at-here, and-he-goes the-hare,
to-walk for no-longer he-fears.

THE WARRIORS AND THE DEVIL
They-are-there formerly the-brothers two who-eat breast,
and-they-stay in-the-kraal of-their-father.
And-they-grow, and-it-them-circumcised-is, and-they-become
the-warriors.
And-he-them-gives one-day their-father the-bullock,
and-he-them-says-to: '(Ye)-go, (ye)-slaugher-(it)'.
And-they-consider-with-one-another, and-they-say-to-one-another:
'Not-we-are-able to-slaughter the-bullock which-us-given-has
us father in-the-place where-it-is-there the-man, or 
the-animal, or the-bird, or the-fly. Let-us-go
to-look-hither the-place where-not-it-is-there
the-thing whihch-lives.'
And-they-take the-spears, and the-clubs, and the-swords,
and the-shields, and-they-go.
And-they-look-hither the-place where-not-it-is-there
the-thing which-lives, and-not-they-it-get.
Now whene they-finished-become-will the-months five,
and-they-reach the-forest big very, and-they-it-enter,
and-they-see not-it-is-there the-man, or the-animal,
or the-bird, or the-fly.
And-they-stay the-few-days, and-he-says-to the-warrior
big the-brother: 'We-slaughter in-this-place the-bullock
our.
And-they-build the-slaughter-house, and-they-slaughter 
the-bullock their. 
Now when they-it-finish to-slaughter, and-he-gives
the-big-one the-small-one the-stomach of-the-bullock,
and-he-him-says-to: 'Go, draw the-water.'
And-he-goes the-river, and-he-says draw the-water,
and-he-hears the-water it-says: 'Oh! he-me-has-drawn,
Oh! he-me-has-drawn
And-he-fear-will he-it-draws, and-he-runs-away.
Now he-runs, and-he-hears the-forest it-laughs.
And-he-returns-hither-himself the-slaughter-house, and-he-says-to
the-brother: 'I-said draw the-water, and-it-me-rebuked
the-water: "Oh! he-me-has-drawn, Oh! he-me-has-drawn."
And-I-say run, and-it-laughs the-forest.'
And-he-him-says-to the-brother: 'Spit-thither these-spittals,
for you-are you coward,' and-he-takes the-stomach,
and-he-goes the-river.
And-it-says the-water: 'Oh! he-me-has drawn, Oh!
he-me-has-drawn.
And-he-it-says-to: 'Yes, I-you-do-on-purpose to-draw.'
And-he-draws the-water, and-he-returns-hither-himself
the-slaugher-house, and-he-says-to the-brother: 'go,
break-hither the-firewood.'
And-he-goes to-break-hiteher the-firewood, and-he-seizes
the-tree to-break, and-they-say the-firewood: 'Oh!
he-us-has-broken us, Oh! he-us-has-broken us.'
And-he-fear-will, and-he-runs-away and-he-comes
the-slaughter-house.
And-he-says-to the-brother: 'They-me-rebuked
the-firewood.'
And-he-him-says-to the-big-one: 'Spit-thither these-spittals,
for you-are you coward, and-he-takes the sword,
and-he-goes to-break-hither the-firewood.
And-they-say the-firewood: 'Oh! he-us-has-broken us, 
Oh! he-us-has-broken us.'
And-he-them-says-to: 'Yes, I-ye-do-on-purpose to-break
ye.
And-he-them-carries, and-he-returns-hither-himself
the-slaughter-house, and-he-says-to the-brother: 'Go
cut-hither the-stakes.'
And-he-goes, and-he-says cut hither the-stakes, and-they-say
the-stakes: 'Oh! he-us-has-cut us, Oh! he-us-has-cut 
us.'
And-he-runs-away, and-he-returns-hither-himself
the-slaughter-house to-tell the-brother.
And-he-him-says-to the-big-one: 'Spit-thither these-spittals,
for you-are you coward,' and-he-goes to-cut-hither 
the-stakes.
And-they-say the-stakes: Oh! he-us-has-cut us, Oh!
he-us-has-cut us.'
And-he-them-says-to: 'Yes, I-it-have-done-on-purpose.'
And-he-them-cuts-hither, and-he-them-carroes the slaughter-house.
And-they-sit the warriors, and-they-roast the-meats,
and-they-them-eat, and-they-sleep.
And-he-comes the-devil night, and-he-strikes
the-fire, and-he-sleeps himself at-here, and-he-lights
the-eye, and-it-becomes like the-fire.
And-he-awakes the-big-one, and-he-awake-causes-to
the-small-one, and-he-him-says-to: 'Make-up the-fire.'
And-he-seizes the-devil the-eye.
And-he-him-swallows-away the-devil, and-he-goes.
And-he-him-says-to the-warrior big: 'Go,
I-you-come to-look-hither to-morrow.'
Now when it-dawns, and-he-him-goes to-look-hither
and-he-him-sees he-has the-heads nine and
the-finger-of-the-foot fat very.
And-he-him-says-to the-devil: 'Go, not-I-wish
and-I-you-strike you, for you-are-strong
And-he-refuses the-warrior, and-he-him-says-to:
Let-us-strike-one-another.'
And-they-strike-one-another and-he-jumps-hither the-devil,
and-he-him-kicks with-the-finger, but the-shield
only he-kicked
And-he-cuts the-warrior the-head one of-the-devil,
and-he-runs-away the-devil.
And-he-him-says-to the-warrior: 'I-come-in-the-morning-hither,'
and-he-returns-hither-himself the-slaughter-house,
and-he-sleeps
Now when it-dawns, and-he-follows the-devil,
and-he-him-goes to-meet.
And-they-fight, and-he-him-cuts the-warrior the-other-head.
And-he-runs-away the devil.
And-he-him-says-to the-warrior: 'I-you-come-in-the-morning-hither
to-strike you altogether' 
And-he-goes-in-the-morning, and-he-follows the-devil,
and-he-him-meets, and-he-him-sees he-is-ill for 
it-him-has-cut-been the-heads both, and-he-him-kills.
Now when he-him-finishes to-kill, and-he-cuts
the-finger-of-the-foot and-they-come-out the-animals
of-the-kinds all, and-he-comes-out from-behind
the-warrior small.
And-they-return-hither-themselves both the-slaughter-house.
Now when they-stay the-days three, and-he-says-to
the small-one the-big-one: 'Take-me the-kraal our
for I-am-afraid.'
And-they-go.
