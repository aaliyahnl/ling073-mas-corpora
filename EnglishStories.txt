'N-ATlNIN OO-'L-MAASAE

The-story of-the-hare and the-elephants.
He-is-there formerly the-hare, and-he-lives (or sits)
by-the-river, and-be-gets (or sees) one-day the-elephants
who-go the-kraals of-the-fathers-in-law their.
And-he-says-to the-big-one who-carrying-is the-bag
of-the-honey : ' Father, (you) make-cross-me the-water, for
l-am poor.'
And-he-him-says-to the-elephant : ' Come ! enter (or mount)
' the-back my.'
And-he-it-enters (or mounts) the-hare, and-they-go.
Now they-it-cross, and-he-eats the-hare the-honey
of-the-elephant, but not-they-know the-elephants to-say (or that)
he-it-eating-is.
Now he-it-eating-is, and-it-him-drops-to the-elephant the-juice
of-the-honey.
And-he-says the-elephant : What this which-me-drops-to ? '
And-he-says the-hare: 'The-tears of-the-child poor.'
Now When they-reach that-bank, and-he-them-says-to the-hare :
(Ye)-give-me the-stones which-I-throw-at the-birds.'
And-it-him-given-is.
And-he-puts-in the-hare the-stones into the-bag
of-the-honey
Now when he-finishes, and-he-them-says-to :
' (Ye)-make-descend-hither-me.'
And-it-him-made-descend-hither-is, and-he-them-says-to: 'Well
then, (ye)-go.'
And-they-go until they-may-reach the-kraal
of-the-father-in-law of-the-elephant big, and-they-sit-down
and-they-unfasten the-bag of-the-honey, and-they-it-look-thither (or regard)
and-they-find the-stones only which-are-there.
And-they-jump, and-they-it-see it-eating-is.
the-hare, and-they-it-see it-eating--is
No when he-them-sees the-hare, and-he-enters the-hole
And-they-him-follow the-of-the-arms, and-he-puts-in the-big-one
the-arm his the-hole, and-he-seizes the-leg of-the-hare.
And-he-him-says-to the-hare: 'I-say I you-seized-have
the-root.'
And-he-it-leaves, and-he-seizes the-root.
And-he-him-says-to the-hare: 'You-me-have-broken,
you-me-have-broken.'
And-he-it-pulls the-of-the-arm very, and-he-it-pulls until 
he-may-tire-himself.
Now he-it-pulling=is, and-he-runs-away the-hare,
and-he-runs-away-thither the-elephant.
And-he-goes the-hare, and-he-gets the-baboons, and-he-says 
the-hare:'O-the-males! (ye)-prevent-hither-me (or intercede-for-me).'
And-they-him-say-to the-baboons: 'What which-it-you-chasing-is?'
And-he-says the-hare: 'The-big-man fat, now
and-ye-him-see he-mi-follows-hither.'
And-they-say the baboons: 'Go you sit
that-we-him-may-see hither for not-we-you-givethither you.'
And-he-goes the-hare in the-cave, and-they-sit
the-baboons to-await the-elephant. 
And-he-comes the-elephant, and-he-says: 'The-friends
ye-have-seen the-hare who-passed here?'
And-they-say the-baboons: 'What you-us-give us
if we-you-tell you?'
And-he-says the elephant: 'I-ye-give ye the-thing
that-ye-wish-will.'
And-they-him-say-to the-baboons: 'Not-we-wish-shall
other-thing, the-bllod your we-wish-shall, 
and-we-you-shoot(or cup) you in-the-small gourd.'
And-he-says the elephant: 'Small this-little-(thing)?
Come-(ye), (ye)-shoot-me.'
And-they-it-go the-baboons to-catch, and-they-catch very. 
And-he-says the-elephant: did-not only it-fills
And-they-say-to the-baboons the-elephant: 'Not-you-have
and again the-honour Not-you-are-able-thither
this-little-gourd
And-he-it-looks-thither the-elephant, and-he-it-finds
did-not it-fills, for it-pierced-becomes the-bottom of-the-gourd,
but not-he-it-knows, and-he-says: '(Ye)-fill-(it).'
And-it-caught-is until may-it-finished-become the-blood
in-the-body, and-he-dies at-here, and-he-goes the-hare,
to-walk for no-longer he-fears.
