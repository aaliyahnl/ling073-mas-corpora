The-story of-the-hare and the-elephants.
He-is-there formerly the-hare, and-he-lives (or sits)
by-the-river, and-be-gets (or sees) one-day the-elephants
who-go the-kraals of-the-fathers-in-law their.
And-he-says-to the-big-one who-carrying-is the-bag
of-the-honey : ' Father, (you) make-cross-me the-water, for
l-am poor.'
And-he-him-says-to the-elephant : ' Come ! enter (or mount)
' the-back my.'
And-he-it-enters (or mounts) the-hare, and-they-go.
Now they-it-cross, and-he-eats the-hare the-honey
of-the-elephant, but not-they-know the-elephants to-say (or that)
he-it-eating-is.
Now he-it-eating-is, and-it-him-drops-to the-elephant the-juice
of-the-honey.
And-he-says the-elephant : What this which-me-drops-to ? '
And-he-says the-hare: 'The-tears of-the-child poor.'
Now When they-reach that-bank, and-he-them-says-to the-hare :
(Ye)-give-me the-stones which-I-throw-at the-birds.'
And-it-him-given-is.
And-he-puts-in the-hare the-stones into the-bag
of-the-honey
Now when he-finishes, and-he-them-says-to :
' (Ye)-make-descend-hither-me.'
And-it-him-made-descend-hither-is, and-he-them-says-to: 'Well
then, (ye)-go.'
And-they-go until they-may-reach the-kraal
of-the-father-in-law of-the-honey, and-they-it-look-thither (or regard)
and-they-find the-stones only which-are-there.
And-they-jump, and-they-it-see it-eating-is.
No when he-them-sees the-hare, and-he-enters the-hole
